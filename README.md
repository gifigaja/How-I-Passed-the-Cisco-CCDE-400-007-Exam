# I Finally Passed the Cisco CCDE 400–007 Exam!

If you’re reading this, you’re probably preparing for one of the most challenging design-focused networking certifications in the industry. I want to share my full experience—what I studied, how long it took, where I failed before (yes, I did), and what I think you should do differently.

Hopefully this helps you prepare better and avoid the mistakes I made along the way.

## Why CCDE?

For years I worked as a senior network engineer focusing on routing, switching, and multisite architectures. But *designing* networks—really designing them—demands a different skill set. The CCDE exam is all about decision-making, trade-offs, and business-driven outcomes.

And it lived up to the legend: it’s tough, deep, and mentally exhausting — but absolutely worth it.

## 🧠 Exam Overview

### **Core Domains**
- Infrastructure design (campus, WAN, DC, cloud)  
- Transport technologies (MPLS, EVPN/VXLAN, SR-MPLS/SRv6)  
- High availability and resiliency models  
- Multicast and QoS architectures  
- Security and segmentation  
- SD-WAN, SDA, network automation & programmability  
- Business constraints, migration, and lifecycle strategy  

### **Exam Structure**
- **2 hours — 90–110 questions (I had 110)**
- Multiple-choice questions with diagrams, business drivers, and design constraints  
- No configuration questions  
- Heavy emphasis on comparing technologies and evaluating trade-offs  
- A few drag-and-drop questions  

> This is a design decision exam, not a technical memorization test.

## 📘 My Study Plan (2.5 Months of Focused Prep)

I had a strong technical background, but CCDE requires something different: **systems-level thinking**. Here’s exactly what I used.

---

### **1. Cisco Official CCDE 400–007 Blueprint (v3.1)**

I read the blueprint line by line and created a mind map of every topic. This helped ensure I wasn’t missing any domain, especially business-related sections such as governance or lifecycle.

#### ✅ What’s New in CCDE v3.1
- Introduction of AI/ML topics under business strategy and governance  
- Increased focus on automation, IaC, CI/CD pipelines  
- Expanded cloud/hybrid design coverage  
- More emphasis on visibility, observability, and compliance in security  
- Updated technology list: SR/SRv6, EVPN/VXLAN, Wi-Fi 7, cloud-managed wireless, modern DC fabrics  

---

### **2. CCDE Practical Workbooks (INE / Orhan Ergun)**

An absolute game-changer. The workbooks included:

- Scenario-based questions  
- Realistic case studies  
- Deep design option comparisons  

I practiced at least 1–2 scenarios daily.
